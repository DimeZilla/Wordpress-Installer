WordPress Installer

This program downloads the latest version of wordpress and then automates some of the advanced configuration techniques for WordPress. This includes moving the content folder to its own folder in the base directory that the user can name themself and moving all wordpress core folders and files into their own directory that the user can name themself.

There is also a new special configuration setup with its own user name config folder and config files loaded by priority in the wordpress standard wp-config.php.
